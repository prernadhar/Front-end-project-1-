        <p class="sectionTag text-big">Reading the ingredient list</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">What do you notice first when you pick up a new skincare product?
        Is it a beautifully designed logo or a catchy tag line? Maybe it’s the divine packaging that catches your attention? Or do you go straight for the ingredients list instead? I never used to, but these days that's the first thing I look at - and I'm proudly geeky about it! <br>
        Beauty product labels can be confusing—and that's putting it mildly. There are so many words, illustrations, and marketing jargon to wade through. Then there are the ingredients. We know they're important, but how can we know what each ingredient is, what it does, and if it's good for our skin? It's tough, but education is paramount, especially when it comes to spending your hard-earned money on products meant to help your skin look its best and stay healthy. .<p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">My aim is to educate people about the ingredients that they put on their face since false marketing gimmick is everywhere and i dont want people to fall into the trap.Saying that, no creams in this world can define who we are.Its the beauty inside that truly matters and nothing can ever beat the beauty of goodwill!
        Want to know a secret that in my opinion is the best way to acheive beauty?Its self love.Yes you read that right.Whoever you are,whatever you like accept yourself,and you will glow inside out!</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Hi there!! My name is Prerona Dhar.The inspiration behind this website is one of my best friends who had a major burn after applying something on her face that apparantly can "get rid of all her skin problems".<br>
            This led me to research more about ingredients,search for the best reports and studies from top doctors and dermatologists.I myself have also exprimented with a lot of ingredients so that you dont have to!Hence everything that is mentioned here is a fact and not gibberish!<p>
